Kumbia Enterprise is a PHP framework whose main objective is the convenience and ease of use, while giving importance to the performance, robustness, quality and professionalism of a web-oriented application. Is implemented using version 5.2 of PHP and is fully object oriented. Components are integrated and optimized thereby increasing the internal efficiency of the framework and the applications developed with it.

The framework further allows the use of libraries and independent components and integrates with third-party application.

The modified version that we developed in Louder Technology has gone through a rigorous process of stabilization and quality production environments that require high availability for applications.

Key Benefits of using Kumbia Enterprise:

  * Reduction of operational costs when implementing large systems
  * Enhanced scalability (clustering, caching distributed)
  * Possibility of getting support at different levels that mitigates risk and helps to  eliminate vendor lock-in of software development tools.
  * Integrate applications with PHP5 code, including other existing frameworks like Zend Framework.
  * Facilities on integration required implementing service-oriented architecture (SOA).

Other improvements in this version:
  * Certified Support for multiple applications on the same instance
  * File structure optimized for multiple applications
  * High and Low Transactions Support
  * Certified adapters for connection to relational databases
  * Hardware requirements reduced by 40%
  * Adapters for scalable session management
  * Security Policy managers with adapters for relational, LDAP, and other (Kerberos5)
